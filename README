The Dextractor commands allow one to pull exactly and only the information needed for assembly
and reconstruction from the source .bax.h5 HDF5 files produced by the PacBio RS II sequencer.
Generally speaking, this information is the sequence of all the reads coded in the .bax.h5 file
and a number of quality value streams needed by Quiver to produce a highly accurate consensus
sequence as the last step in the assembly process.  The Dextractor therefore produces a .fasta
file of the sequence of all the reads, and a .quiva file containing the stream information in
a .fastq readable format.  For each of these two file types the library contains commands to
compress the given file type, and to decompress it, which is a reversible process delivering
the original uncompressed file.  In this way, users of a PacBio can keep the data needed for
assembly spooled up on disk in 1/14th the space occupied by the .bax.h5 files which can be
archived to a cheap backup medium such as tape, should the raw data ever needs to be consulted
again (we expect never unless the spooled up data is compromised or last in some way).  The
compressor/decompressor pairs are endian-aware so moving compressed files between machines
should never be an issue.

1. dextract  [-qS] [-o[<path>]] [-l<int(500)>] [-s<int(750)>] <input:bax.h5> ...

    The dextract'or takes some number of .bax.h5 files as input and:

    (a) if the -o option is set, then the information needed for Quiver is extracted and put
          in a file named <path>.quiva.  If the -q option is not set, then the sequence of
          each read is place in a file named <path>.fasta, otherwise a .fastq file of the
          sequence and the imputed "quality values" for each base in the sequence is placed
          in a file named <path>.fastq.  We personally do not find these values useful and
          so never set -q but we give you the option in case your downstream processes use
          such values.

          If <path> is missing, then the path of the first .bax.h5 file is used for the output
          file name, less any suffixes which are replaced by .fasta and .quiva.  For example,
          the call "dextract -o EColi.1.bax.h5 EColi.2.bax.h5 Ecoli.3.bax.h5" will result in
          the files EColi.fasta and Ecoli.quiva.

    (b) if the -o option is not set, then if the -q option is also not set, then a .fasta file
           of the sequence of each read is written to the standard output.  Otherwise a .fastq
           file is written to the standard output.

    If the -S option is set then the program runs silently, otherwise it indicates the processing
    of each .bax.h5 file.  The parameter -l determines the shortest read length to be extracted
    (default 500) and the -s parameter determines the minimum quality/score of reads to be
    extracted (default 750 = 75%).

2. dexta   [-Sk] <path:fasta> ...
   undexta [-Sk] <path:dexta> ...

    Dexta compresses a set of .fasta files (produced by either Pacbio's software or dextract)
    replaces them with new files with a .dexta extension.  That is, submitting xxx.fasta will
    result in a compressed image xxx.dexta, and xxx.fasta will no longer exist.  With the -k
    option the .fasta source is *not* removed, and with -S set, the program runs completely
    silently (good for batch jobs to an HPC cluster).  The compression factor is always
    slightly better than 4.0.  Undexta reverses the compression of dexta, replacing the
    uncompressed image of xxx.dexta with xxx.fasta.

3. dexqv   [-Skl] <path:quiva> ...
   undexqv [-Sk]  <path:dexqv> ...

    Dexqv compresses a set of .quiva files (produced by dextract) into new files with a .dexqv
    extension.  That is, submitting xxx.quiva will result in a compressed image xxx.dexqv, and
    xxx.quiva will not longer exist.  The -k flag prevents the removal of xxx.quiva and the
    -S option makes dexqv completely silent.  If slightly more compression is desired at the
    expense of being a bit "lossy" then set the -l option.  This option is experimental in that
    it remains to be seen if Quiver gives the same results with the scaled values inducing the
    loss.  Undexqv reverses the compression of dexqv, replacing the uncompressed image of xxx.dexqv
    with xxx.quiva.  The flags are analgous to the S and k flags for dexqv.  The compression
    factor is typically 3.4 or so (4.0 or so with -l set).

  To compile the programs you must have the HDF5 library installed on your system and the
library and include files for said must be on the appropriate search paths.  The HDR5 library
in turn depends on the presence of zlib, so make sure it is also installed on your system.
